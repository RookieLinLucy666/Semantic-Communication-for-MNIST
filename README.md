# Semantic-Communication-for-MNIST

A small example for MNIST recognizing in semantic communication（AWGN）

Using Cnn+Linear layers

Net structure is semantic encoder-> channel encoder-> channel-> channel decoder ->semantic decoder

In this code, every image can be compressed to 16 features. The accuracy can reach 96%.

You also can try to reduce the num of features, there will be some change in the last result.
